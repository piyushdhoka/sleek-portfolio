# Spark Studio : Manim Goated

## Overview

Spark Studio `revolutionizes` video creation by turning your text descriptions into broadcast-quality `2D` animated videos in seconds, not weeks.

## Features

- Real-time music streaming
- Social features
- Chat functionality
- Playlist
- Song recommendations
- Song search
- Song playback & controls

## Why i built this

I built this project to solve the complexity of creating educational animated videos.  
Traditional video animation requires expensive software, months of learning, and weeks of production time.  
Educators, developers, and content creators have amazing ideas but lack the technical skills to bring them to life visually.
