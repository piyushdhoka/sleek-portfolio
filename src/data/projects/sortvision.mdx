# SortVision : Interactive Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview

Developed an interactive sorting algorithm visualizer that helps users understand and compare popular sorting algorithms through real-time animations and intuitive controls. The platform is designed for students, educators, and anyone interested in learning how sorting algorithms work under the hood..

# Key Features
# Tools I've Implemented

Algorithm Visualizations: Step-by-step animations for algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and more, with adjustable speed and array size.

User Controls: Start, pause, reset, and randomize arrays to experiment with different scenarios and observe algorithm behavior.

Responsive Design: Fully responsive UI for seamless experience across devices, including mobile and desktop.

Educational Insights: Display of algorithm time/space complexity, code snippets, and explanations alongside visualizations.

Customizable Themes: Light/dark mode and color customization for accessibility and user preference.
